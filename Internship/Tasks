Overall Project Summary: From Data to Action
Main Goal: Use customer data to predict and prevent credit card delinquency (customers failing to make payments).
________________________________________
Task 1: Data Detective (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA)
•	What you did: You played detective with the data file (like an Excel sheet).
•	Key Questions: What is the quality of our data? What are the early warning signs of a customer who might not pay?
•	Main Steps:
1.	Found Missing Info: Discovered empty cells in important columns like Income and Loan Balance.
2.	Found Red Flags: Discovered that high Credit_Utilization (>50%) and multiple Missed_Payments are strong signs of future delinquency.
•	Why it matters: You can't build a good prediction on bad data. This step cleaned the data and found the most important clues.

Task 2: The Prediction Machine (Predictive Model)
•	What you did: You built a "crystal ball" to predict who might become delinquent.
•	Tool Chosen: Logistic Regression.
o	Why? Because it's perfect for Yes/No questions ("Will this customer default?") and it's easy to understand and explain.
•	How it works:
1.	It uses the red flags from Task 1 (Credit_Utilization, Missed_Payments) as its main ingredients.
2.	It gives each customer a risk score (a percentage chance they will default).
3.	It then gives a final prediction: 1 (High Risk) or 0 (Low Risk).

Task 3: The Action Plan (Business Recommendations)
•	What you did: You translated the model's predictions into a real-world game plan.
•	Main Idea: Don't just know who is at risk—do something about it!
•	Example Plan:
o	Target Group: Customers under 30 with 2+ missed payments.
o	Action: A 6-week pilot program sending them helpful SMS and email reminders offering support (like payment plans), not just demanding money.
o	Goal: To help them before they become delinquent, reducing risk and building trust.

Task 4: The Auto-Pilot System (AI-Powered Strategy)
•	What you did: You designed a smart, self-improving system to run the action plan on autopilot.
•	How it works:
1.	It automatically checks customer data in real-time.
2.	It uses the prediction model (from Task 2) to score everyone.
3.	It automatically triggers actions (like an SMS from Task 3) for high-risk customers.
4.	THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: The Learning Loop: It checks if the SMS worked. Did the customer pay? It uses this result to get smarter over time, learning what works best for different types of people.

 
“This internship was theory-based, focused on predicting and reducing credit card delinquency. I explored the dataset to spot risk factors like high credit utilization and missed payments, then designed a logistic regression framework to show how risk could be predicted. I also suggested a business action plan, like SMS reminders, and outlined an AI-powered system concept to automate and improve collections. The goal was to learn the full process from data to business impact.”
